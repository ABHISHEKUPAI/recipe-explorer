## How to Work on Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and improvements.  
Each issue is labeled by difficulty  **easy**, **medium**, or **hard** - so contributors can pick tasks that match their skill level.

### Steps to Solve an Issue

1. **Find an Issue**  
   Browse the [Issues](../../issues) tab and pick one that interests you.

2. **Assign Yourself**  
   Comment under the issue:  
   > "I'd like to work on this."

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-<number>
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**  
   Edit the required files (`index.html`, `style.css`, or `script.js`) and test locally.

5. **Commit Your Work**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: <short description of your change>"
   ```

6. **Push and Open a Pull Request**
